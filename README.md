I deployed a bank application using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. I set up a CI/CD pipeline in the Jenkinsfile that included stages for checking out the code from GitHub, building the application with Maven, running tests, performing SonarQube analysis, and building Docker images. I also integrated a Trivy scan for vulnerability assessment before pushing the images to Docker Hub and triggering the continuous deployment pipeline. This project enhanced my skills in automating deployment processes, managing containerized applications, and ensuring security compliance, all crucial in the banking sector.
